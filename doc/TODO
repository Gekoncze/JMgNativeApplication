add list field and list view
    implement list field (fields per row inside ui list)
    implement list field factory
    implement list view
    add mouse click selection to UiList
    add multi selection to UiList

move explorer into entity framework
    extract explorer from gui
    change tests to use some new test entity classes instead of mg ones

add cleanup button
    will offer to delete objects that are not owned
    add button to main menu
    change icon of remove - unify delete and clear

add test that checks that all services have a test
    add missing tests

bug in ui list field
    clicking on icon does not select field
    check if this should be handled somehow in ui value field

optional investigations
    check if it would be possible to get rid of entity select content

improve multi select
    add drag and drop move action
    add keyboard shortcuts to move up / down
    add keyboard shortcuts to select next / previous item

add more icons
    MgCommand
    MgExpression
    Boolean
    Enum
    Integer
    String

navigation
    add menu items for right click in navigation tree
    add navigation bar
    add button to locate currently opened object in navigation tree

idea for mouse event traversal (check if this doesn't work in swing by default)
    investigate if this should be implemented
    for each ui component, register a mouse listener
    the handler will iterate to top most parent
    then it will propagate an onEnter event down to the target component
    then it will propagate an onLeave event up to the top most parent component
    consume should stop the propagation

add validations
    add validation on navigation refresh + display error icon
    add validation on component refresh + highlight errorneous fields + add tooltip
    run validations for all entities before export or compile

entity view
    add field select display order customizations
    add field select display customization

add more unit tests
    transaction
    transaction manager
